# Python Bootcamp
Annual 4 day workshop on Python

## Install python
In windows we'll use WinPython. 
For 2018 class  We use WinPython64-3.7.0.2. Download from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.7/3.7.0.2/WinPython64-3.7.0.2.exe/download) and install in your computer. 


## Learn the basics
I recommend learning python as if you are learning to swim or to ride a bicycle. No point of reading too many manuals or trying to understand how everything works **before** trying it. Get the essential level of knowlege so that you are not running a risk to your life or others' and **just start doing it**. There **will** be a time to read manuals and you **will** understand most of the things eventually - but trying from the day one to **do it** is very important.

Having said that, you need some go-to place to find basics about a topic once in awhile. Following is a good list:

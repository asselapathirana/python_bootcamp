Annual 4 day workshop on Python

## Learn the basics
I recommend learning python as if you are learning to swim or cycle. No point of reading too many manuals or trying to understand how everything works **before** trying it. Get the essential level of knowlege so that you are not running a risk to your life or others' and just start. There **will** be a time to read manuals and you **will** understand most of the things eventually - but trying from the day one is very important.

Having said that, you need some go-to place to find basics about a topic once in awhile. Following is a good list:
